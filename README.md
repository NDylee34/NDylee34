## About Me:
My name is Judy Lee and I’m a senior studying business analytics, finance and CDT at the University of Notre Dame. I was born in Seoul, South Korea and was raised in Sao Paulo, Brazil. 

I am greatly interested in pursuing a career in finance as I find the intricacies and ambiguity of the financial world fascinating. Through active involvement in Student International Business Council, I’ve furthered my interest in this industry. This past summer, I worked at Citigroup as an investment banking summer analyst, and I look forward to returning there full-time after graduation.

Beyond finance, I am also greatly interested in tech and data analysis. I believe that my business analytics major and my CDT minor provide me with great opportunities to further my learning in these areas. I also work as an undergraduate learning analytics research assitant at the Kaneb Center of Teaching and Learning, in which I’ve been part of several projects like prompt engineering workshops and the genAI/online exam sentiment surveys.
