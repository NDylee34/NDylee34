# Elements of Computing II Portfolio - Judy Lee

## About Me:
My name is Judy Lee and I’m a junior studying business analytics, finance and CDT at the University of Notre Dame. I was born in Seoul, South Korea and was raised in Sao Paulo, Brazil. 

I am greatly interested in pursuing a career in finance as I find the intricacies and ambiguity of the financial world fascinating. Through active involvement in Student International Business Coucnil, I’ve furthered my interest in this industry. This upcoming summer, I will be working at Citi as an investment banking summer analyst. I'm looking forward to a great summer with a lot of growth and learning. 

Beyond finance, I am also greatly interested in tech and data analysis. I believe that my business analytics major and my CDT minor provide me with great opportunities to further my learning in these areas. I also work as an undergraduate learning analytics research assitant at the Kaneb Center of Teaching and Learning, in which I’ve been part of several projects like the LSRS analysis and the genAI/online exam surveys.
